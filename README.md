# Secure S3 Website

This project demonstrates how to host and secure a static website on AWS S3.  
It shows both **cloud** and **cybersecurity** skills by combining web hosting with security best practices.

## What I Did for this project
- Created an S3 bucket to store website files
- Enabled static website hosting
- Applied a least-privilege bucket policy (read-only)
- Enabled default encryption 
- Checked public access settings for secure configuration 

## Live Demo

## Lessons Learned
- S3 static hosting makes cloud deployment simple
- Bucket policies are key for securing access
- Encryption at rest is one click in AWS
- AWS S3 static hosting only provides HTTP if I was to develop this further HTTPS can be added with CloudFront and a TLS Certificate.
